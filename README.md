# CryptoClustering

## this code contains the solution for the challenge.

## I used code from class, and I used chagpt as reference for some issues.

## Answer the following question:
# What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
## Easier to Work With: With fewer features, the data is less complicated, making it easier to see patterns and clusters.
# Less Noise: PCA helps to remove unnecessary information, focusing on the most important aspects of the data.
# Faster Processing: With fewer features, the K-Means algorithm runs faster, which is great when working with large datasets.
# Better Clusters: Sometimes, fewer features can help the algorithm find clearer and more distinct clusters.
